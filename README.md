```bash
jupyter-notebook eigenface.ipynb
```

```bash
jupyter-notebook segment.ipynb
```

## Package Dependencies

The `eigenface.ipynb` file makes use of the following packages:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

The `segment.ipynb` file makes use of the following packages:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
